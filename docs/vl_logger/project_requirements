Problem Statement:
We need a tool that will allow us to more efficiently interpret logs from executed tests and extract more information that is readily visible from various sources.
For formatting, this includes:
  - using color to differentiate between log types,
  - filter logs by type,
  - filter log fields,
  - condense logs to a single line,
  - align fields from line to line
More information to be extracted includes:
 - clearly display the API calls and responses
 - duration of suites/test cases/steps
The user can choose the following
 - what log types to filter,
 - what log fields to filter
Various sources:
 - log files that have already been generated,
 - locally running test executed from the tool,
 - AT2 task instances.


Features:
As a user, format logs from a local file that uses color to differentiate between log types, filter logs by type, filter log fields, condense logs to a single line, align fields from line to line.

As a user, choose to show API calls and responses in a clear manner

As a user, choose to what suites/test cases/steps to show and their durations

Provide a config file that allows user to decide what log types to filter, what log fields to filter

As a user, execute a local suite and format the output as it is being produced.
