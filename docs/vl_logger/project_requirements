Problem Statement:
We need a tool that will allow us to more efficiently interpret logs from executed tests. This includes
using color to differentiate between log types, filter logs by type, filter log fields, condense
logs to a single line, display logs from specified suites, test cases, and steps, align fields from line
to line and clearly display the API calls and responses. The user can choose what log types to filter,
what log fields to filter, what suites/test cases/steps to view, whether to see formatted API calls. This
 tool will format the logs from the following sources: log files that have already been generated,
 locally running test executed from the tool, AT2 task instances.

User stories:

Color log type field based on type
The log type fields on each log will be colored a unique color based on the type. The more important
critial the log, the more contrasting color should be used.

Color suite/test case/step headers
The headers for the suites, test cases, steps are to be colored with contrasting colors in order to
quickly identify.

 - Filter logs based on log type
 - Condense logs to fit on a single line
 - Filter log fields
 - Convert timestamp from UTC to custom timezone
 - View API calls and responses
 - View logs from specific suites/test cases/steps
 - Read and format from log file
 - Format from AT2 Valence task step instance
 - Execute and format test suite using vl
